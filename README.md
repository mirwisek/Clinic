# Clinic

## Database
Clinic uses Hibernate HSQL DB and creates local database files while the program is run and it if that database folder is deleted the records will be lost

## Printing Invoice
The app can print the invoice if printer is connected

## Creating Invoice
When adding line into the invoice, you will have to add the **product** and **client**; both of these will require you to search the product or client when you hit SPACE_BAR and then BACK_SPACE you will see the list of all clients and products; I didn't fix this issue yet.
